### What I Learned
Responsive Design
One of the major takeaways from this project was learning how to create a responsive design that adapts seamlessly across various devices. Specifically, I focused on:

Media Queries: Using CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on different screen sizes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
/* Mobile styles */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    body {
        flex-direction: column;
        padding: 0px;
        margin: 0;

        
    }
}
    
    main {
        padding: 10px; /* Reduced padding for smaller screens */
        
    }
    
    .recipe-information {
        padding: 10px; /* Reduced padding for smaller screens */
    }
